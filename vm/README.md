# Todo

- Write a visitor to make the symbol table 
    - For each function, create a data structure to store the scope info of each var (local, global, free) that can be used to create the CFG 
    - see "CollectionsVisitors" file in the root as sort of an example of a visitor for scoping stuff

- CFG: Handle variable writing/storing (depends on symbol table) 

- CFG: Handling function definitions/calls 

- CFG: Records
